# Proof of concept Prisma project

This was a boilerplate/proof of concent project using prisma, graphql, and quasar. I tried to write high quality reusable code and tried to set a good example/best practices. One thing I would do differently, I would probably seperate out client and server code into their own repos as you could have multiple different clients that would reuse the same backend.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, yarn install all the dependencies for both the client and the server. You can run your server with vscode or yarn run dev. Run the client with basic quasar commands.
